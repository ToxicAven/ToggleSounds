@Doogie13 thought this would be funny, and I wanted to see if I could use mixins into Lambda using Lambda Plugins.

Turns out I can, by setting `remap = false` in the mixin annotation.

### THIS IS DESIGNED USING BETA FEATURES

This plugin will only work with the beta features of Lambda, run #303 was used for testing.
